This project has a basic implementation of Dense and Conv2D layers from scratch (without using any existing tool: keras, pytorch, tf, ...) as well as the methods required to compute the back propagation algorithm and train a 
real model. 

To execute on GPU, 'numba' and 'cudatoolkit' could be use, but it out of the scope of this project.

## Examples

This project comes with 2 jupyter notebooks that solve 2 well known beginner's problems in AI:
- ... (MNIST dataset)
- Digits Image classification (MNIST dataset)
